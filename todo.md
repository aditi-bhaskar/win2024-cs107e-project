## bugs
 - @anjali: after the piece lands on another piece and I use "tuck", it moves correctly, moves down once, then pauses for a few seconds before continuing further down. this is prolly bc of our tuck implim. For example, tall l block, lands on other upright l block, then I "tuck" left, so it moves left 1 col and down 1. Then it pauses for a sec or 2. Then it continues going down and game resumes normally.
 - doubling of the piece sometimes (sideways)
 - schiff tv blehhh
