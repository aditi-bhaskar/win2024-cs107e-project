1) 0x0f OR 0xff = 0xff which is 255 in decimal. Left shifted by 24, the number becomes 255 * 2^24 in decimal which is 0xff000000 in hexadecimal.

2) Using Ohm's Law, I = V / R = 3 V / (1500 ohms) = (0.002 A)(1000 mA / 1 A) = 2 mA

3) One file in the /etc directory is the bash.bashrc file which contains 2319 bytes. There are 720 files and directories contained in the first level of the /etc directory. I found this by doing cd ~/etc to move into the directory and then ls -l to list the contents of the directory with extra information. 

4) /home/anjalisr/cs107e_home/mycode/cs107e is the absolute path to the folder. I can quickly change into this directory using the cd $CS107E command because of the environment variable created during setup. 

5) I plan on using Vim! I've been learning how to best use my editor by reading the 107 guide on Vim and watching the video tutorial, and by working my way through vimtutor. To customize my editor, I've created a .vimrc file and enabled linebreaks, text wrapping, line numbers, and syntax highlighting. I've also selected a built-in colorscheme (darkblue). 

6) A commit is a checkpoint or snapshot along the progression of a Git project -- we manually commit and include an associated message when we get to a point where we want to save our work/progress. A branch in Git is a way to diverge from the main development line and make changes. Branches can also be merged throughout the development process.

7) Outside of Google searching, I haven't explored too much into resources beyond what you all have provided for us. I like how concise and clear the 107 Unix reference is, and explainshell.com has also been super useful.
